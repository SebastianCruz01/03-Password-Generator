# Password Generator 

Welcome to Password Generator 3000!

This tool helps you generate a secure password by prompting you to select password criteria such as length and character types. The generated password will meet the selected criteria and can be displayed in an alert or written to the page.

Here's how to use the tool:

Click the button to generate a password.
When prompted for password criteria, select which criteria to include in the password.
When prompted for the length of the password, choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
When asked for character types to include in the password, confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
Answer each prompt and validate your input. At least one character type should be selected.
Once you have answered all prompts, a password will be generated that matches the selected criteria.
We recommend using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to create a strong and secure password. Remember to keep your password confidential and do not share it with anyone.

Thank you for using the Password Generator 3000!
